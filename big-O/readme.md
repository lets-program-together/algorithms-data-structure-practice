## Big O
Lets us measure the scalability of code. Given the input size (n), many operations (how long) and or how much memory will it take for a function to accomplish the task?
* Big O emphasizes on the worst case senario.
* Drop the constant from the final Big O expression.
* Each input has their own term.
* Drop non-dominant terms.
* Big O measures Time as well as Space complexity.

### Different time/space complexities:
* O(1): constant
* O(n): linear
* O(n^2) quadratic
* O(n^n) exponential


For time complexities, we count every operation. For space, we count every variable/data-structure declared.
