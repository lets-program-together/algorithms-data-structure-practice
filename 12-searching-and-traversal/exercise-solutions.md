* If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
*Breadth-first search*

* If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
*BFS might be faster than DFS for this case (memory usage may be a concern)*

* If the tree is very wide:
*DFS since BFS may run into memory constraints*

* If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
*Depth-First search*

* Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
*Depth-First search*

* Finding the shortest path:
*Breadth-First search*
