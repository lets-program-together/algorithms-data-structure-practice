* If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
*Breadth-first search*

* If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
*Depth-First search since less memory will be used to search for answer*

* If the tree is very wide:
*Breadth-First search*

* If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
*Depth-First search*

* Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
*Depth-First search*

* Finding the shortest path:
*Breadth-First search*
