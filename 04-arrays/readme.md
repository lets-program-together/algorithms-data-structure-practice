## Arrays
Also known as lists. Stores items contiguously (one after another).
| **action* | **Big-O** |
| lookup    | O(1) |
| push      | O(1) |
| insert    | O(n) |
| delete    | O(n) |

### Two types of arrays:
* Static: Memory is allocated ahead of time and cannot change.
* Dynamic: If more memory is required, memory is allocated for a new array and data is copied over from old array.
