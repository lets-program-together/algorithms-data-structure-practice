## Linked List
Is a data structure that is similar to arrays but has the advantage of flexible memory allocation.
| **action* | **Big-O** |
| lookup    | O(n) |
| push      | O(1) |
| insert    | O(n) |
| delete    | O(n) |

### Singly vs Doubly Linked-Lists:
* Single, the list can only be traversed in direction.
* Double, the list can traversed forwards or backwards but. This can optimize lookup time (still O(n)) at the cost of additional space.
