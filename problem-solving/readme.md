## Technical Problem Solving
* Data Structures
* Algorithms

1. What are the key points of the problem?
2. What are my inputs? What are my outputs?
3. What is the most important value of this problem? Do I want to optimize for space or time?
4. Start with a brute force approach. We don't have to code it but we should be able to intelligently describe the solution.
5. Where are the bottlenecks in this approach? (Things with the biggest big O)
6. Write down steps that you will take before you start coding.
7. Modularize code from the get go.
8. Think about error handling and edge cases. How might your code break? Which piece might you write tests for?
9. Ask about the most interesting solutions the interviewer has seen?
