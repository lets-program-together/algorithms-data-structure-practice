## Technical Problem Solving Require:
1. Analytic Skills
2. Coding Skills
3. Technical Skills
4. Communication Skills

### Questions to ask yourself and others when solving technical problems.
1. What are the key points of the problem?
2. What are my inputs? What are my outputs?
3. What is the most important value of this problem? Do I want to optimize for space or time?
4. Start with a brute force approach. We don't have to code it but we should be able to intelligently describe the solution.
5. Where are the bottlenecks in this approach? (Things with the biggest big O)
6. Write down steps that you will take before you start coding.
7. Modularize code from the get go.
8. Think about error handling and edge cases. How might your code break? Which piece might you write tests for?
9. What are some interesting solutions that others have come up with?
10. How might we deal with an input size that requires more memory than our one computer can handle?
